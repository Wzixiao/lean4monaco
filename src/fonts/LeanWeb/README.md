# LeanWeb Font

This font currently only contains 8 glpyphs:

* 🎉: Used for "No Goals"
* ❌, ✅, 💥, ▼, ▶: Used for instance synthesis debugging
* 🎭: Used in Lean4game as "no goals, but warnings"
* ✝: used for inaccessible variables.

The main purpose of this font is to provide overwrites where the glpyhs from
[JuliaMono](https://juliamono.netlify.app/) are not ideal for Lean. E.g. the glyphs "❌✅" aprovided
in JuliaMono are monochromatic and therefore hard to see.

The colourful glyphs (emojis) in this font are copied from Google's
[NotoEmojiColor](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji); the monochromatic glyphs are of original
creation.

The font was made using the software
[Glyphs 3](https://glyphsapp.com/) (trial).
